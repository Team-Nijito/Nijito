	/// <summary>
	/// Implements several character commands for the Yarn scripts to use.
	///
	/// These commands are specific to manipulating characters.
	/// General commands are in the
	/// [StageCommands](@ref Dialogue.VN.StageCommands) class.
	///
	/// Note that, whenever you have a name of an asset (e.g. an
	/// animation) which contains a space, you
	/// must wrap it in double quotes.
	/// 
	/// For any command with options such as **now**, **quickly**,
	/// and **slowly**, these options control the relative speed
	/// of the movement. Note that the exact speed depends on the
	/// command being used.
	///   * **now**: Instant; all delays and animations are skipped.
	///   * **quickly**: Snappy and quick. Good for fast or hurried motions.
	///   * (nothing): Standard speed. Should work for general situations.
	///   * **slowly**: Drags things out.
	///
	/// For commands with **wait** or **and wait** options, those
	/// will cause the dialogue system to pause until the command
	/// finishes being carried out. This does nothing if **now** is
	/// also used. Also be careful of combining this with **slowly**
	/// too often; that might make things draggy.
